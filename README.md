**MQTT tanks**
I'm a lazy huaman being, there's no other way around that.  In my endevors to avoid having to get off of my couch, I have setup my own home automation system using tasmota and mqtt.  This allows me to remain in one my place while 
still being able to adust lights around my home.  Currently my steam deck is my only device that dosn't have the ablity to talk to my mqtt service.  I want to build a tool worthy of the steam deck that will allow me to turn lights 
on and off with out having to get up and find my phone, walk over to my desktop, find my laptop, swich to my media center box, or actually go over to the light and turn it off.
